    { name: 'Jennifer Dionisio', program:"NCAS-RN/IGA", feedback: 'Ms. Marilee is such a blessing to IENs who wants to pursue nursing career in Canada. She is such an inspiration and always encourage us that everything is possible through hardwork and perseverance. She taught us many things about the Canadian Healthcare system and definitely learned a lot from it. With her great expertise gained from her vast nursing experience, this is something that you cannot learn from the books. After the NCAS review, it gave a light for my nursing career and I want to pursue it despite the many challenges that we IENs already faced. She told us that there is only delays, but we can reach the destination of being RNs here in Canada. Thank you so much for inspiring, sharing your knowledge and resources and helping us through this journey.' }
